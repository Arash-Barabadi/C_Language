/**
 * Passing pointers to functions is a great way to solve some challenging tasks. 
 * One example is swapping value. 
 * You have two variable values, which are taken from input, and you need to swap the values. 
 * The given code declares two variables, takes them from input and passes them to a swap() function, as pointers. 
 * The swap() function needs to swap their values.
 * Task: Define the swap() function so that given code works as expected.
